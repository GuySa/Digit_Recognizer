Machine Learning exercises I do with the MNIST dataset.  
src/digit_recognizer.py contains a solution using openCV to pre-process the images and than a
Support Vector Machine.  
Currently i'm working on refactoring the code so that the pre-processing will be in a separate file
and than I'll add new implementations (CNNs and Random Forests are on the list).
